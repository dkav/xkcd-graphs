# xkcd Graphs
xkcd styled graphs created in d3, Python and R.

Python and R graphs are coded within a Jupyter notebook.

Python graph requires matplotlib.

R graph requires ggplot2 and xkcd packages. R code is executed via rpy2. To setup R locally, prep_r.R needs to be run first.

Daniel Foreman-Mackey created the [d3 style](http://dan.iel.fm/xkcd/).
Emilio Torres-Manzanera is the maintainer of the R [xkcd package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xkcd/index.html).
Michael Droettboom created the [xkcd sketch-style drawing mode](http://matplotlib.org/users/whats_new.html#xkcd-style-sketch-plotting) for matplotlib.
