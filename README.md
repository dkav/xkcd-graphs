# xkcd Graphs
xkcd styled graphs created in d3, Python and R.

d3 graph can be viewed on [bl.ocks.org](//bl.ocks.org/dkav/2f55cb1ad8f8ca2eba7d30fdf091278a).

Python and R graphs are coded within a Jupyter notebook.

Python graph requires matplotlib.

R graph requires ggplot2 and xkcd packages. R code is executed via rpy2. To setup R locally, [prep_r.R](/jupyter/prep_r.R) needs to be run first. Can be viewed in [Jupyter Notebook Viewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dkav/xkcd-graphs/blob/master/jupyter/jpn_xkcd.ipynb).
